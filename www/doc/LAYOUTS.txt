There's a few possible ways to run this mess. Either on a single SBC like a raspberry pi or on a few micros.

If your uc has enough resource and network connectivity, you could probably use that.

Otherwise you might need to setup an esp32 with firmware that handles the network connectivity (HTTP).

For now, development is happening on linux on a pi, for simplicity. Eventually we'll move to smaller targets.
