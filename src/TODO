[makefile]
Make things so that make debug forces a make clean & adding make debug if last built without debug (can we use nm or such to check symbols)

[porting]
- Shorten strings where possible
- Wrap strings for storage as appropriate on micros (stm32? ;)

[buildconf]
- Support for loading older (input) eeprom layouts, according to version saved in the EEPROM
  - see res/archive/*

[Network]
    net/ip4 and net/ip6 split
    net/prefer_ip4
    net/ignore_icmp_echo
    net/ignore_mcast
    net/ignore_bcast

[HostInterface]

[Backplane]

[CAT]
* Implement control over unix pipes in posix mode
* Implement control over stm32 serial over usb

[Porting]
minimal inet_ntop() for non-posix

[eeprom]
* remove need for they key field (why not use the name of the entry itself?) in eeprom_layout
* fix relative offsets in eeprom_layout
* Create a minimal tokenization of eeprom name references, so we don't have to store full strings all over
